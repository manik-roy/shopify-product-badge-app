# Shopify App Template - Remix

This is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using the [Remix](https://remix.run) framework.

<!-- TODO: Uncomment this after we've started using the template in the CLI -->
<!-- Rather than cloning this repo, you can use your preferred package manager and the Shopify CLI with [these steps](#installing-the-template). -->

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
1. You must [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you don’t have one.
1. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).

<!-- TODO Make this section about using @shopify/app once it's added to the CLI. -->

### Setup

If you used the CLI to create the template, you can skip this section.

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn install
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Local Development

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Press P to open the URL to your app. Once you click install, you can start development.

Local development is powered by [the Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli). It logs into your partners account, connects to an app, provides environment variables, updates remote config, creates a tunnel and provides commands to generate extensions.


This template come preconfigured with examples of:

1. Setting up your Shopify app in [/app/shopify.server.js](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/shopify.server.js)
2. Querying data using Graphql. Please see: [/app/routes/app.\_index.jsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/app._index.jsx).
3. Responding to mandatory webhooks in [/app/routes/webhooks.jsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/webhooks.jsx)

Please read the [documentation for @shopify/shopify-app-remix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/shopify-app-remix#authenticating-admin-requests) to understand what other API's are available.

### Build

Remix handles building the app for you, by running the command below with the package manager of your choice:

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn build
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run build
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run build
```

## Hosting

When you're ready to set up your app in production, you can follow [our deployment documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web) to host your app on a cloud provider like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

When you reach the step for [setting up environment variables](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web#set-env-vars), you also need to set the variable `NODE_ENV=production`.



### OAuth goes into a loop when I change my app's scopes

If you change your app's scopes and notice that authentication goes into a loop and fails with a message from Shopify that it tried too many times, you might have forgotten to update your scopes with Shopify.
To do that, you can run the `config push` CLI command.

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn shopify app config push
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run shopify app config push
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run shopify app config push
```

## Tech Stack

This template uses [Remix](https://remix.run). The following Shopify tools are also included to ease app development:

- [Shopify App Remix](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/blob/main/packages/shopify-app-remix/README.md) provides authentication and methods for interacting with Shopify APIs.
- [Shopify App Bridge](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/app-bridge) allows your app to seamlessly integrate your app within Shopify's Admin.
- [Polaris React](https://polaris.shopify.com/) is a powerful design system and component library that helps developers build high quality, consistent experiences for Shopify merchants.
- [Webhooks](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/tree/add_remix_package/packages/shopify-app-remix#authenticating-webhook-requests): Callbacks sent by Shopify when certain events occur
- [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/): Design system that enables apps to create Shopify-like experiences

> **Note**: This template runs on JavaScript, but it's fully set up for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
> If you want to create your routes using TypeScript, we recommend removing the `noImplicitAny` config from [`tsconfig.json`](/tsconfig.json)
